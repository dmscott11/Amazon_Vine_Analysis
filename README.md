# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
In an effort to look at the data collected by the Amazon Vine program, we were tasked with looking at data for specific items sold by Amazon (i.e. watches) and finding out how many reviews were provided by individuals who are a part of the program. In looking for this answer, we also found out how many 5 star reviews are associated with these reviewers, and how many reviews they actually leave in relation to the total review count. 
## Results
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  - **Vine Reviews** : 47

## Analysis
Looking at the data, it does not appear that there is any inherent bias towards members of the Vine program being more inclined to leave 5 star reviews. The % of reviews that are 5 stars and were left by non-vine affiliated reviewers is 20% higher than their vine affiliated counter parts. 
### Issues
Due to the small sample size of vine reviewers who rate watches, this percentage might be skewed. In total there were only 47 vine reviewed watches out of 8,409 total reviews. By looking at larger sample sizes, we would be able to more accurately determine whether vine associated reviews are more likely to be biased.
